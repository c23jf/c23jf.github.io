<p> Everyone has been out of school for Spring Break and because of the Coronavirus, so I haven't added to my coding journal in awhile. Here is my article of clothing that would create invisibilty for the user. This is an all black sweatshirt with a zipper that goes all the way up the hood so that your face is covered, but has tiny wholes so the user is able to see.</p>
